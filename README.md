# UFOs
## Project Overview
  This project covers the ability to create JavaScript arrays and present them in a table hosted on a dynamic website.  This website utilizes a collection of UFO sighting data that allows the user to filter the sightings based on such conditions as date and locations.
  
## Resources
  * Data Source 1: data.js
  * Software: JavaScript, HTML
  
## Results
Using JavaScript we were able to create a dynamic website with a built in search feature to filter UFO sighting data.  This easy to use site features an extensive list of UFO data.

A visitor to this webapge has the ability to filter this list of UFO data using the above search feature.  All they need to do is enter in their desired criteria and the table (shown below) will update with any matching results.

Once the desired search criteria has been entered the table will update with the relevant information. (shown below)

### Summary
One of the largest drawbacks from this design is there is no way to determine what information is available to filter.  The user is left to guess at which dates or other search criteria may or may not be available.  A suggested improvement to this would be to change the filter input boxes to cascading drop down menus that filter based on all previous filters to assist the user in drilling down their search requirements.  Not only does this showcase the scope of the stored information but it also simplies the searching of the data.  Another improvement would be to use web scraping to pull in recent articles about UFO sightings to compliment the searchable data.
